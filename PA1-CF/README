			In the name of GOD

This is the Client Framework (CF) of PARTOV system.
Before any other work open the "userpass.sh" file with an editor
and type your username and password there.

Then you could use the .sh files for running your programs as follows:
 - The "new.sh" for instantiating a new topology for you.
 - The "free.sh" for releasing the previously assigned topology instance.
    * Do not forget to free the instance when your simulation finished.

 - The "tunnel1.sh" and "tunnel2.sh" for connecting your program to virtual tunneler nodes.

At the end, do not forget to change/adapt the Makefile so it creates "tunneler.out" correctly
when the "make" command is issued.
